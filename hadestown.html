                <p>Over spring break, my sister decided to take me to the city for a sister's bonding day. She wanted to
                    take me out to see a Broadway show and how we would both pay half the cost for one ticket while our
                    parents paid for the other. We decided on Hadestown because Brooke had seen it before and assured me
                    I would love it. Considering my love for Greek Mythology and musicals, I agreed. On the bus ride to
                    the city, I listened to the soundtrack for the first time and fell in love. Once we got into the
                    theatre and I saw the stage, I knew I was in for a wild ride. The set was amazing and the songs
                    incredible. The song Wait for Me quickly became my new favorite sad Broadway song—its beauty and
                    emotion moved me to tears. I found myself crying multiple times throughout the performance,
                    overwhelmed by both its artistry and its heartbreak. The myth itself is a tragedy, and seeing it
                    unfold in a gritty, jazzy, industrial-style production was nothing short of extraordinary. I
                    expected it to be good, but I never imagined it would instantly become one of my all-time favorites.
