                <p>I saw Newsies on Broadway back around 2012 shortly after its release. My dad worked for Theatermania
                    and got tickets for the whole family. I was very young and although right now I can’t remember the
                    exact date I saw the show, I certainly remember the show. Despite being around 5 years old, I
                    remember it vividly and loved it immediately. The soundtrack became a staple in car playlists for
                    family road trips/long car rides. When a recording of the show was released on demand in 2017.Since
                    I was older I was able to enjoy the show even more and with a better understanding of the storyline
                    itself. It was just as amazing as viewing it in person if not better since I then was old enough to
                    truly respect the beauty of the show. Considering that it was one of the first musicals that I saw,
                    it will always be a favorite that I will love forever.
